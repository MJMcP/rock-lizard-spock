# <em>'Rock! Lizard! Spock!'</em>

'Rock! Lizard! Spock!' is an interactive front-end site that responses to the user's choice of game token against an automated generated token. The site's aim is to provide the user with a portal of entertainment as they partake in a game of chance, while documenting within the game the user's success tally and options to continue or quit the game.

# User Experience UX
The user demographic is anyone with access to an internet accessible device from age 6 years and up. By this age, the user will have the literary and critical thinking skills to follow the instructions and complete the tasks in order to complete the game.

## Design Choices
  
### Typography
The fonts chosen for this project were <em>Merriweather Sans</em> for the headings (h1, h2 etc), <em>Cabin</em> for the body text and a third text of <em>Quattrocento Sans</em> for the button text.

![Fontjoy Font Pairing Tool](/assets/images/fontjoyTextSelect1.jpg)

Merriweather Sans is described on the Google fonts site as "a low-contrast semi-condensed sans-serif typeface ... designed to be pleasant to read at very small sizes." It was chosen due to the complementary styling it has with Cabin and the modern contours it possesses.

Cabin is said to incorporate modern proportions , optical adjustments and elements of the geometric sans (Google Fonts). While Google's <em>Noto</em> font families have greater language support, Cabin's language support includes full Latin coverage of Vietnamese, in addition to all Western, Central and South/Eastern European languages.

Quattrocento Sans was chosen for the buttons in order to create an additional visual difference from the main game play area of the game. Designed by Impallari Type who also created Cabin, it is seen as warm, readable and non-intrusive typeface what will be used in it Bold 700 style within the project.

### Colour Scheme
Due to the associations of this game with various television franchises, I chose to use strong colours that would have slight comicbook connotations to them. Using [colormind.io](https://colormind.io) and [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel), I was able to assemble a colour palette that would allow for good contrast and vibrancy. 

<!-- SCREENSHOT color wheel, color accessibility palate and font shades for buttons and headings-->

Due to the desire to visually differientiate the main game play and game exit buttons, an additional colour was added to the palette for easy text readability of the exit button.

<!--Features

 This is the launch page for the game. The user will read the games instructions and choose one of animated icons. This will awaken the green <em>Engage</em> button in order to activate the random generator that will choose the computers choice. Once the button has been clicked, the game-area will alter to reflect the user's choice and the computer'c choice. The screen will also show a tag line that will iterate whether you won, lost or tied with the computer.

## Future Features to Implement
  - Greater language support: such a simple game can find itself popular amoung any society who enjoys the concept and activity of the game. With this in mind, the plan will be to introduce further language supporting fonts that will complement the feel of the website. <!--Noto-->

## Technologies Used

In the creation of this project I have used the following:

- Balsamiq to create the wireframes.
- HTML5 to provide the content and structure for the website.
- CSS to provide the styling.
- JavaScript to provide the responsive support needed to allow for game interaction. 
- Github to host and edit the website.
- Gitpod to deploy the website.
