# <em>'Rock! Lizard! Spock!'</em>

'Rock! Lizard! Spock!' is an interactive front-end site that responses to the user's choice of game token against an automated generated token. The site's aim is to provide the user with a portal of entertainment as they partake in a game of chance, while documenting within the game the user's success tally and options to continue or quit the game.

# User Experience UX
The user demographic is anyone with access to an internet accessible device from age 6 years and up. By this age, the user will have the literary and critical thinking skills to follow the instructions and complete the tasks in order to complete the game.

## External User Goals  
- As a user, I want to access the game all on one page.
- As a user, I want to understand the instructions as they is presented to me.
- As a user, I want to clearly make out the icons and buttons to enable play.
- As a user, I want to clearly see the outcome of my game performance.
- As a user, I want to exit the game early should I wish to.

## Site Owner's Goals
- As the owner, I want to provide an entertaining game that can be played by the user through their preferred device.
- As the owner, I want the user to play the game for a limited number of tries before offering them the opportunity of another round.
- As the owner, I want to provide a score tracking function that will stay increment wins and losses until the player reaches a best-out-of-5 tally.
